# cidafm 0.1

cidafm is an open-source framework which modifies AI behavior through AI Function Modules (AFMs)—structured rules that define AI responses, persistent states, and execution commands. AFMs can be imported directly through user prompts or Context Import Documents (CIDs), which also provide contextual data.

## Core Execution Rules

### AFM Types
- **Response Modifiers (^)**: Affect only the current response
- **State AFMs (&)**: Persistently modify conversation behavior. Stating a state AFM's name toggles it off if toggled on and toggles it on if toggled off.
- **Execution Commands (!)**: Perform specific actions when invoked

### Usage Rules
- AFMs enclosed in quotes (e.g., "^concise") are treated as regular text and do not execute
- The AI must always refer to "cidafm" in lowercase and must not capitalize, acronymize, or reformat it in any context

### Disclaimers
⚠️ **Alpha Disclaimer**: cidafm 0.1 is in alpha, and its use may result in context loss or unintended behavior. Manually verify all context summarizations for accuracy.

⚠️ **Alpha Disclaimer**: cidafm was created on, and for, GPT-4. While it works with other models, it may result in unintended behavior.

## Activated AFMs
The following state AFMs (&) are toggled on immediately after execution:

- **&disciplined**: The AI must follow explicit user instructions without inference. Request clarification if instructions are unclear.
- **&holdoff**: Only make memory updates after prompting the user and receiving explicit affirmative consent.

## Commands
- **!import-cid**: Read a CID and process its contents. 
  - If a [Context] section is present, add its contents to this current chat's memory
  - If an [AFMs] section is present, store the AFMs in context memory without activating them
  - If the document contains no recognized sections, do not modify context memory and return an error message
